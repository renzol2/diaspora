# Diaspora

## Background

**Diaspora** is an experimental music composition that serves as an expression of my experience growing up in the Filipino diaspora, disconnected from my parents’ life in the Philippines. It is also a direct product of my personal journey learning about Filipino culture during college.

This piece involves recorded samples of the *kulintang*, a percussive instrument consisting of eight bossed gongs commonly played in the southern regions of the Philippines. The samples were recorded from a kulintang donated to the [Philippine Student Association at UIUC](https://www.psauiuc.org/) for use in performances and recordings by their cultural dancing group, [PSA Barkada](https://www.psauiuc.org/cultural-chair/).

Different cultures across the Philippines have distinct styles and traditions for playing the kulintang. The style of kulintang music from Maguindanao, a province in the southern island of Mindanao in the Philippines, is the most cited in ethnomusicology work and contemporary practitioners.

## Implementation

The implementation of **Diaspora** involves the triggering of samples determined by Markov systems built from Maguindanaoan kulintang transcriptions recorded by musicologist Dr. Kristina Benitez and kulintang master Prof. Aga Mayo Butocan. I developed the Markov systems using Professor Heinrich Taube’s [musx](https://pypi.org/project/musx/) algorithmic composition software library, with audio processing in [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/).
